# Authentication System Fixed! 🔐

## ✅ **Issues Resolved**

1. **Admin/Librarian Credentials**: Fixed hardcoded credentials that weren't working
2. **Approved Users Only**: Implemented strict authentication that only allows approved users to login
3. **Email Authentication**: Restricted email login to approved users only
4. **Member Authentication**: Proper handling of approved member applications

## 🔧 **Authentication Logic Fixed**

### **Credentials Provider (Username/Password Login)**

The authentication now works in this order:

1. **Admin Credentials** (Hardcoded)
   - Email: `davel@admin.library.com`
   - Password: `myDavellibraAdminiCITIE123@`

2. **Librarian Credentials** (Hardcoded)
   - Email: `davel@librarian.library.com`
   - Password: `myDavellibraLooktoCITIES456@`

3. **Database Users** (Users with passwords)
   - Checks existing users in database
   - Verifies password with bcrypt
   - Allows ADMIN, LIBRARIAN, and MEMBER roles

4. **Approved Members** (Default password)
   - Checks for approved membership applications
   - Uses default password: `member123`
   - Creates user account automatically if needed

5. **Rejects Non-Approved Users**
   - Users with pending or rejected applications cannot login
   - Clear logging for debugging

### **Email Provider (Magic Link Login)**

- **Only allows approved users** to use email authentication
- Checks user status in database
- Checks application status for new members
- Rejects non-approved users immediately

## 🔑 **Login Credentials**

### **Admin Access**
```
Email: davel@admin.library.com
Password: myDavellibraAdminiCITIE123@
```

### **Librarian Access**
```
Email: davel@librarian.library.com
Password: myDavellibraLooktoCITIES456@
```

### **Member Access**
```
Password: member123
(Email: Any approved member's email)
```

## 🛡️ **Security Features**

## 📝 **Environment Setup**

The `.env.local` file has been created with:

```env

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"

# Email Configuration
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT="587"
EMAIL_SERVER_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD="your-app-password"
